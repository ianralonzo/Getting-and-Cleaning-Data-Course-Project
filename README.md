# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The purose was to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. I was required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with my script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. I was also to include a README.md in the repo with my scripts. This repo was explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

 **Script Called run_analysis.R
 
 I had create the R script called run_analysis.R that did the following. 

  - Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  - Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  - Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  - From the data set in the prevous step, created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for     each activity and each subject.
