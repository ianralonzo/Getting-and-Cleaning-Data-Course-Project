First the working directories were set.  
Then the train and test data were read into tables. 
The files X_test.txt, y_test.txt, and subject_test.txt were merged into the test data table.
Then the files X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt were merged into train data table. 

Both the train and test data sets were merged to create one data set called Xymerged.

From features.txt the indices corresponding to the variables describing mean values and standard deviations were 
obtained. This was done by selecting variables which names contain "mean" or "std".  Only the measurements 
on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement were extracted from both train and test data tables 
and combined into a single table (also including columns with corresponding subject ids and activity labels).

A second, data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created. The rows were 
sorted so that activities performed by each subject were in adjacent rows.  Each activity label was replaced with 
the corresponding activity name from activity_labels.txt.

The column namee were:

Subject: .. range of values [1:30] .. id of a subject performing ther activity
Activity: .. Name of activity performed
The Rest of the columns corresponded to averaged variables describing the following mean/std measurements:
- tGravityAcc-mean()-X 
- tGravityAcc-mean()-Y 
- tGravityAcc-mean()-Z 
- tGravityAcc-std()-X 
- tGravityAcc-std()-Y 
- tGravityAcc-std()-Z

The names of these variables are the same as in features.txt, but the values are averages of each variable for each 
activity and each subject.
